# Installation
---------------
Installing this theme is pretty easy. After download you should have a karta.zip (compressed file with all folders and files of this theme).

### Installation
You can use WordPress Admin Panel to install this theme or do it manually.
###### WordPress Admin Panel

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
2. Click on **Add New**
3. Click on **Upload Theme**
4. Choose the `karta.zip` file
5. Click on **Install Now**

###### Manually ( FTP )

1. Exctract the `karta.zip`
2. Using an FTP client or Control Panel to access your host web server and upload `karta` folder to the `wp-content/themes`


#### Activate the theme
After installation you can click on **Activate** or:

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
2. Hover over the **Karta** screenshot and click on **Activate**

# Adapting existing content
---------------
If you already have menus and widgets on the website, you need to do this after finishing the theme activation process:

1. Go to **Appearance > Menus** and update theme locations
2. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and add old widgets to new sidebars

If you already have uploaded images on the website, you should regenerate thumbnails. To do that you can install [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.

If you didn't use featured images you can install the [Easy Add Thumbnail](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) plugin to dinamically set featured images for old published posts.


# Limitations
---------------
#### Post Format Link
It is envisaged that content of this post format is only an external link. In the list of the posts, link text is displayed instead of the post title and click leads to its URL.


# Customization
---------------
### Customizer
To open WordPress Customizer go to **Appearance > Customize**. There you will find the following sections:

#### Site Identity
